# BGAN

To run this codes, you should do follow things:<p>
1. extract resnet feature and then run create_S.py to construct similarity matrix.<br>  You can download cifar-10.mat training data and  cifar_KNN.npz from <a href="http://pan.baidu.com/s/1geUCy0F"> here </a> 
2. download vgg19 pretrained model on ImageNet.
3. run BGAN.py to train network and you can set parameters in BGAN.py.
